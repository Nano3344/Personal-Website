        <p>Hi there, my name is Malik Ebers and I am a
           17 year old highschool student and graduate
           from Berlin, Germany. I am currently attending
           the Elinor-Ostrom school to get my A-level to
           attend college. Before studying at this school,
           I visited the USA as an exchange student and
           graduated from the Maroa-Forsyth-Highschool in
           Illinois. I am currently living in Berlin and I
           consider myself an entrepreneur, designer and
           programmer. If you have any questions or requests

     <h1>Technology</h1>
     <p>I have been coding since I was 15 years old

        I mostly create websites and android apps, but also enjoy
        game development as that was one of the first things I got into
        when I wanted to start programming. My web development skills consists of HTML,

     <h1>Sports</h1>
     <p>Sports take a very large chunck of my life, as I am active with Sports
        almost every day of my life. My first official sport was swimming, however
        quickly gave in to swimming and had a very long break for sports. My passion
        for sports was really awoken by my exchange year in the USA. Since I came home
        Germany again, I started Tricking, Basketball and Lifting weights and have
        progressed a lot since then.

     <p>I am very passionate about music and play
        regurarly the drums. I started to play the guitar
        when I was 6 years old and the moved on to the drums
        when I was 10. Since then I loved playing the drum kit
        and playing to almost any music genre there is. I also started
        to play the electric guitar once again and to progress further.
